## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Input lag | Use wired peripherals, lower quality to 720p30 |
| Video stuttering | Check network speed, ensure wired connection |
| Audio issues | Restart PulseAudio: `pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio --start` |
| Connection problems | Try different DNS (8.8.8.8), clear browser cache |

### Performance Tips
- **Network**: Use wired Ethernet, optimize with `sudo ethtool -K eth0 gro off gso off tso off`
- **Temperature**: Monitor with `vcgencmd measure_temp`, ensure good ventilation
- **GeForce Now**: Start with 720p30, use "Balanced" quality setting

## üìã Network Requirements

### For Optimal GeForce Now Performance
- **Minimum**: 15 Mbps download, <40ms latency
- **Recommended**: 25+ Mbps download, <20ms latency  
- **Optimal**: 50+ Mbps download, wired ethernet connection
- **Ping**: <20ms to GeForce Now servers for best experience
