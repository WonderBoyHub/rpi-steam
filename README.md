## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Input lag | Use wired peripherals, lower quality to 720p30 |
| Video stuttering | Check network speed, ensure wired connection |
| Audio issues | Restart PulseAudio: `pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio --start` |
| Connection problems | Try different DNS (8.8.8.8), clear browser cache |

### Performance Tips
- **Network**: Use wired Ethernet, optimize with `sudo ethtool -K eth0 gro off gso off tso off`
- **Temperature**: Monitor with `vcgencmd measure_temp`, ensure good ventilation
- **GeForce Now**: Start with 720p30, use "Balanced" quality setting

## üìã System Requirements

### For GeForce NOW Streaming
- **Minimum**: 15 Mbps download, <40ms latency
- **Recommended**: 25+ Mbps download, <20ms latency
- **Optimal**: 50+ Mbps download, wired Ethernet connection
- **Network**: Wired connection strongly recommended over Wi-Fi

## üìÅ File Structure

```
/home/gamer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ geforce-now-launcher.sh         # Main GeForce NOW launcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Desktop/GeForceNow.desktop       # Desktop shortcut
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .config/openbox/                # Kiosk window manager config
```

After running the optimizer script, you'll also have:
```
/home/gamer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launch-geforce-now-optimized.sh # Advanced optimized launcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitor-gaming-performance.sh   # Performance monitoring
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ geforce-now-troubleshooting.md  # Troubleshooting guide
```

## üîí Security Notes

- Kiosk user has limited system privileges
- Auto-login enabled (suitable for dedicated gaming setups)
- Emergency exit provides administrative access
- Sudo access limited to specific gaming-related commands
